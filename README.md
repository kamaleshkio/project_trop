1. SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
The Software Development Life Cycle is a systematic process for building software that ensures the quality and correctness of the software built. SDLC process aims to produce high-quality software which meets customer expectations. The software development should be completed within the pre-defined time frame and cost.
SDLC Phases
The entire SDLC process is divided into the following stages:
 
•	Phase 1: Requirement collection and analysis
•	Phase 2: Feasibility study
•	Phase 3: Design
•	Phase 4: Coding
•	Phase 5: Testing
•	Phase 6: Installation/Deployment
•	Phase 7: Maintenance




2. Platform Knowledge
Introduction to Python:
Python is developed by Guido van Rossum. Guido van Rossum started implementing Python in 1989. Python is a facile programming language so even if you are new to programming, you can learn python without facing any issues. Python is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming ever more popular for data science. Companies worldwide are using Python to harvest insights from their data and gain a competitive edge. Python specifically for data science. To store and manipulate data, and helpful data science tools to begin conducting your own analyses. 
What is Python?
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general purpose programming language. It is dynamically typed and collected. Python is an interpreted language and not a compiled one, although compilation is a step. Python code, written in .py file is first compiled to what is called byte code which is stored with a .pyc or .pyo format. Instead of translating source code to machine code like C++, Python code it translated to byte code. This byte code is a low-level set of instructions that can be executed by an interpreter.  One popular advantage of interpreted languages is that they are platform-independent. As long as the Python byte code and the Virtual Machine have the same version, Python byte code can be executed on any platform (Windows, MacOS, etc).Dynamic typing is another advantage. In static-typed languages like C++, you have to declare the variable type and any discrepancy like adding a string and an integer is checked during compile time. In older programming languages, memory allocation was quite manual. Many times when you use variables that are no longer in use or referenced anywhere else in the program, they need to be cleaned from the memory. Garbage Collector does that for you.
 

Domain Knowledge:
 Block Chain:	
A block chain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved record cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks. This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively. A block chain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed time stamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests. Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a block chain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. A block chain has been described as a value-exchange protocol. This block chain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems. A block chain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.

3. About the Project 
3.1 Abstract
The certificates are a mandatory quality document that must be attached to every part of mandatory places like schools, colleges, work, etc.. While the process of obtaining a certification is standard, the process of storing the certificate and maintaining it throughout the life cycle for quality purposes requires a considerable amount of effort. With the current traditional approach it is unable to share the certificate beyond their immediate next level. We proposed block chain system to store and process the valuable certificates throughout the life time of a person. Due to the complex nature and security concerns the certificates are not digitally stored and processed using clouds and other environment. Block chain technology provides the high level of security towards the transactions in important places, and it is also used for secure storage and retrieval process. By managing the unique identity between the users we can handle the chain mechanism and utilize block chain effectively. A utility function is planned to choose exchange pools to frame blocks that add an ideal operational incentive for accomplishing pre- decided creation yields over block chain-based organizations.
3.2 Scope of the project
	Block chain technology is one of the fastest-growing technologies for keeping the record and properties safe.  The safety features of Block chain technology are so good that other industries have also started testing it secure their structures and records. Many studies have been carried out for digital currencies and Block chain technology, which represents that both of these technologies will be continuing to disrupt the world. Block chain is a forward looking, highly sophisticated and secure distributed record keeping system which will help in the storage and analysis of large amount of database which can be traced down to all past transactions. The model is based on consensus and hence all the transactions will have to be validated and approved of, by all the members of the group before the transaction. It is a system based on trust and autonomy which will make the life of at taxpayer easy and the process of tax collection efficient. The block chain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value. 
3.3 Existing System
	In existing system the Existing arrangements are fundamentally intended for block chain frameworks utilized in digital currency applications where excavators use the thought of charges to ensure the need of exchange handling. At last hubs must compensation higher charges and outbid others to ensure the handling of their data. In any case, the data will need to sit tight for a more extended timeframe. Charge based plans are worthwhile for users as they are a basic strategy for choosing the need of exchange preparing just as the capacity to create an convergence of monetary benefit. Despite the fact that the idea of charges is straightforward, they are not suitable for mechanical applications because of their ethical risk. The physical natures of the documents are highly risk and it is not able to access from anywhere. And keeping the files digitally may face security issues. There is a need for a better system and protocol to handle it.
 	 
3.3.1 Disadvantages
	There is no proper technology to handle the confidential data.
	Accessing certificates from anywhere is difficult.
	Need to convert digitally and store it in smart phone and PC for further process.
	No connectivity storage mechanism between the certificates. 
	
	
3.4 Proposed System
	The proposed system utilizes the block chain technology to store and process the certificate data efficiently. This model provides the user an unique identity with in the block chain. After that the identity mechanism is handled throughout the lifetime of a person to store the certificates. Due to the chained connectivity nature and high security parameters each and every data is saved wisely and only authorized persons able to access the data. A real-time process is given to overcome the computational complexity of the aforementioned utility function. The real-time process utilizes ageing to increase the priority of transactions residing in mining pools. Furthermore, a transaction block is sliced into compartments to hold
a number of transactions from a received priority class. Subsequent to determining the size of slices, transactions are selected from the mining pool with the priority given to aged transactions first.  
 	
3.4.1 Advantages
	Data stored in block chain is highly secured by the use of hash functions.
	Access the certificates from anywhere by a secured way.
	Each stage the certificates are stored using a specific identity.
	Authorized entities only access the data.
	Hackers can access to only a specific block, other blocks were not accessible.
4. Bottom line and Future Enhancement
	While block chain is not the cure all for the certificate storage system, it could be applied in a number of areas to reduce the administrative burden and maintenance at a lower cost. The world re-revolutionized the way information is exchanged, block chain is transforming the way we exchange value. The Block chain is a forward looking highly digitized system. The keeping the certificate safe and efficient access as a use case of Block chain were discussed and analyzed. 
Block chain holds a lot of promise and governments all over the world are quite excited about implementing blockchain in the tax systems. The government will have to rope in data scientists land IT professionals to design a block chain platform. With the current government and its emphasis on digital India, Block chain seems to be the ideal solution for efficient accessing of data.
